//
// This package consists of the most minimalistic web server ever (after hello
// world maybe). It takes 5 seconds for it to start ( :o ) to simulate bigger
// services that would take some time to be ready (ready=healthy
// load-balancer-wise) and it then replies with the list of IP addresses the
// machine/container it runs into has access to (one per interface).
